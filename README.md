# RSA Encryption and Decryption in C++
This repository contains C++ code implementing the RSA encryption and decryption algorithm.

## Server (RSA Encryption)
The `server.cpp` file demonstrates RSA encryption. Users can input the base number, exponent, and modulus to perform modular exponentiation and obtain the encrypted result.

## Client (RSA Decryption)
The `client.cpp` file showcases RSA decryption.

### Implementation Details
- It implements modular exponentiation and the Extended Euclidean Algorithm for efficient computation.

This repository serves as a basic illustration of how RSA encryption and decryption can be implemented in C++.
